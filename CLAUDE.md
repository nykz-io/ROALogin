\# Darkfall Rise of Agon - Game Data Tools



\## Project Overview



We want to create a solution that will seamlessly add "remember password" type functionality to the launcher login for Rise of Agon.

- The solution should not require the user to manually run anything, but should automatically and silently start when Rise of Agon does and fill in the most recently used password, then terminate itself.


\## Dev Environment



\- \*\*Shell\*\*: Bash (Git Bash/MSYS2), not cmd.exe - use bash syntax even though platform is win32

\- \*\*Paths\*\*: Use quoted paths (`cd "C:\\Dev\\..."`) not Windows `/d` flag

* \*\*OS\*\*: Windows



\## Development Guidelines



* \*\*Language\*\*: Python or AHK
